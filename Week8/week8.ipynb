    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| ID  | This is a unique customer identifier. It has no predictive power and should be dropped to prevent the model from memorizing individual observations.  | Non-Predictive  |\n",
    "| Dt_Customer  | Date of customer enrollment. While conversion time might be relevant, the more actionable and direct time-based feature, Recency, is already available and highly predictive (as shown in Graph 3).  | Redundant/High Cardinality  |\n",
    "| Z_CostContact  | Standardized cost of customer contact. This column is constant across all customers in the dataset (a value of 3) and therefore provides zero variance or predictive information.  | Zero-Variance |\n",
    "| Z_Revenue | Standardized revenue from contact. This column is constant across all customers (a value of 11) and provides zero variance or predictive information.  | Zero-Variance |\n",
    "| AcceptedCmp1 to AcceptedCmp5 | Response to previous campaigns. These features represent the outcome of past offers. Using them to predict the current campaign's Response (which is effectively AcceptedCmp6) creates severe data leakage, as a positive response to a previous similar campaign is an unnaturally strong predictor for the current one. Dropping these ensures the model generalizes to new campaigns.  | Data Leakage |\n",
    "| Complain | Customer complaint status. While technically a potential predictor, the count of complaints is extremely low, leading to highly skewed classes that provide minimal signal for a classification model focused on positive response prediction.  | Near Zero-Variance |\n"
